**Update: 2017/09/01**
The version 2 is working now, I've changed the design to build a Raspberry Pi Zero hat  
But because board size limit, I removed Radio_A for layout simplicity, also changed the 1.8V power supply from LDO to step-down, and pull the 3.3V directly from Raspberry Pi, more over, added GPS module for PPS supply.

note that I haven't get it working yet, stuck in PLL lock  
but SPI test seems to be OK.
